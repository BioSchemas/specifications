**Bioschemas specification for describing data repositories and data catalogues in the life-sciences.** 

# Description 
This document covers the schema.org and bioschemas.org properties necessary to describe data repositories, catalogues and databases in the life sciences, organised by their requirement level (M for mandatory, R for recommended and O for optional) and driven by a set of use cases. A simple example in JSON-LD is also provided. The majority of these fields already exist in schema.org, others are pending. 
Note that this draft will be improved progressively through the bioschemas process.
