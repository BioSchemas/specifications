  description: A Taxon type from a well known vocabulary, e.g. DarwinCore http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Taxon
    or http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonConcept#TaxonConcept An additional type
    for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies
    in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that
    the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax -
    the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker
    understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
