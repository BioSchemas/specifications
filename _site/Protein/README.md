# Protein Specification 

## Type

## Profile
The [Protein Profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Protein) provides details for providing markup for a protein resource.

### Links to other relevant profiles

Protein records will be included in a Dataset which will belong to a DataCatalog. A Protein can also be related to Protein Annotation or Protein Structure

- [DataCatalog](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/DataCatalog/)
- [Dataset](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Dataset/)
- [ProteinAnnotation](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ProteinAnnotation/)
- [ProteinStructure](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ProteinStructure/)

### Example Markup

This repository contains example markup for the Protein profile generated by the [Proteins group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Proteins/). Examples are purely illustrative and may use fictional data. 

Examples should be stored in a subfolder indicating which version of the profile it is valid for. Please check to ensure the example you are reading matches the version of the profile you are interested in. 

#### Examples Combining Protein with Data Record

We include examples not just for proteins but also for records describing proteins. As Protein we will model the entity itself (name, organism, gene, and so), while as Record we will model a bit more technical stuff (latest modifed date, dataset where it belongs to, citations, distribution and so).
