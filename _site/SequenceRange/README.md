# SequenceRange Specification 

## Type

Thing > [BioChemEntity](https://bioschemas.org/BioChemEntity) > [SequenceRange](https://bioschemas.org/SequenceRange)

## Profile
The [SequenceRange Profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/SequenceRange) provides details for providing markup for a sequence range. The sequence could be a nucleic acid, e.g. Gene, DNA, or RNA, or an amino acid, e.g. Protein.

### Example Markup

This repository contains example markup for the SequenceRange profile generated by the [Proteins group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Proteins/). Examples are purely illustrative and may use fictional data. 

Examples should be stored in a subfolder indicating which version of the profile it is valid for. Please check to ensure the example you are reading matches the version of the profile you are interested in.
