# Sample Specification

## Type

Thing > [Sample](https://bioschemas.org/Sample)

## Profile

The [Sample Profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Sample) presents the Bioschemas markup when describing a Sample. 

For BioSamples, please use the more specific [BioSample Profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/BioSample).

### Example Markup

This repository contains example markup for the Sample profile generated by the [Samples group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Samples/). Examples are purely illustrative and may use fictional data. 

Examples should be stored in a subfolder indicating which version of the profile it is valid for. Please check to ensure the example you are reading matches the version of the profile you are interested in.

### Other examples

We include examples not just for samples but also for records describing samples. As Sample we could model the entity itself (name, organism, additionalProperties, etc.), while as DataRecord we will model a bit more technical stuff (latest modifed date, dataset where it belongs to, etc.).
