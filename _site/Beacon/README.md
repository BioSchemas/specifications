## Profile 
This [profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Beacon) provides a simple way for a beacon to self-describe their genetic variant cardinality service for better integration with other beacons within the beacon-network. It builds upon the Beacon service API and uses existing Schema.org entities and properties.
