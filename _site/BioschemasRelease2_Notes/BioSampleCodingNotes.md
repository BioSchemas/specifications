# Proposal of BioSample Type

The [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org) community would like to propose a new type for marking up details of biological samples such as those found in bio banks, museums, and herbaria.

## Background

The `BioSample` type has been discussed in the Bioschemas community in:

- Issues
  - [Discussion on Sample Type properties](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/issues/306)
  - [Human & Museum examples](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/issues/299)
  - All issues labelled [Sample](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=label:"type:+Sample")
- Bioschemas community mailing list thread
  - [BioSamples type for review](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-bioschemas/2019May/0007.html)
  - All emails containing the term [Sample](https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Public/advanced_search?keywords=&hdr-1-name=subject&hdr-1-query=sample&hdr-2-name=from&hdr-2-query=&hdr-3-name=message-id&hdr-3-query=&period_month=&period_year=&index-grp=Public__FULL&index-type=t&type-index=public-bioschemas&resultsperpage=20&sortby=date-asc)

The proposal is an evolution of an earlier prototype of a Sample type developed for exchanging data about samples and deployed on the [EBI BioSamples archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/). 

## Proposal

The proposed type is available at http://sdo-bioschemas-227516.appspot.com/BioSample (a cached copy is also available on the Bioschemas [website](https://bioschemas.org/types/BioSample/)).

We summarise here the design decisions taken to reach this proposal.

### Type Hierarchy

We are proposing to add the `BioSample` type under a `BioChemEntity` type which inherits from `schema:Thing`. `BioChemEntity` is being proposed as an umbrella type that the various types coming from Bioschemas will be placed under. This is to prevent bloat at the top level of Schema.org. `BioSample` will reuse some of the properties from `BioChemEntity`, e.g. `associatedDisease` and `taxonomicRange`.

An alternative would be for there to be a more generic `Sample` type in Schema.org with `BioSample` being a child. You could imagine there being a need to markup a sample of a product for sale which would have a different emphasis from a `BioSample`. Similarly, there have been discussions with the Bioschemas community about the need for a `GeoSample` that would include spatial properties, or `StatisticalSample`, but we have not worked on either of these. If this approach is favoured by the Schema.org community, then the `associatedDisease` and `taxonomicRange` properties would need their definitions extended, unless a multi-inheritance of `Sample` and `BioChemEntity` is used.

### Properties

- additionalProperty: 
Range extended to include `BioSample`.
- collector: *New property*
Considered [`creditedTo`](https://schema.org/creditedTo) but felt that the two were distinct from each other in their intended use.  
There are also distinct uses of these terms to refer to different entities, i.e. who collected the sample versus who it is credited to.
- custodian: *New property*
Considered `accountablePerson` but range only permitted `schema:Person`. The custodian of a sample is often an `schema:Organization`.
- dateCreated:
Range extended to include `BioSample`.  
Potential issue is that the description of `dateCreated` mentions `CreativeWork` which `BioSample` does not inherit from.
- gender:
Range extended to include `BioSample`.
- isControl: *New property*
- itemLocation
Range extended to include `BioSample`.
- locationCreated
Range extended to include `BioSample`.  
Potential issue is that the description of `locationCreated` mentions `CreativeWork` which `BioSample` does not inherit from.
- samplingAge: *New property* 
Considered `age` but felt that was too generic, particularly with the proposed description of the property.
