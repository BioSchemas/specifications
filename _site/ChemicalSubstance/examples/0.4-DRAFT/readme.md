# How to embed the BioSchemas JSON-LD in HTML

The JSON-LD can best be autogenerated and embedded in HTML with a `<script>` element like this:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "ChemicalSubstance",
  "identifier": "50-78-2",
  "name": "Benzoic acid, 2-(acetyloxy)-",
  "url": "https://commonchemistry.org/ChemicalDetail.aspx?ref=50-78-2"
}
</script>
```

The JSON-LD here is minimal content for the [ChemicalSubstance](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ChemicalSubstance/0.4-RELEASE/).
This folder contains three examples, with varying levels of marginality:

* [Minimum](commonChemistry_minimum.json)
* [Recommended](commonChemistry_recommended.json) (at least at the `ChemicalSubstance` level
* an [extended example](commonChemistry_extended.json)
