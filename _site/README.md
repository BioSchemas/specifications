# Bioschemas Specifications Repository
We use the Bioschemas Specifications repository to:

- Provide example markup for profiles, see [below](#profile-examples)

- [Track issues](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/issues) relating to Bioschemas specifications (profiles and types), website, and governance 

- Give detailed guidance for specification development and support tools through the [wiki](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/wiki)

The content of the Bioschemas [website](https://bioschemas.org/) is managed in the [bioschemas.github.io](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas.github.io) repository, while the [governance structure](https://github.com/BioSchemas/governance/blob/master/governance.md) of the Bioschemas community is managed in the [governance](https://github.com/BioSchemas/governance) repository.

## Profile Examples

The folders in this repository correspond to the [profiles](https://bioschemas.org/profiles) developed by the Bioschemas community. 

Within each folder, you will find a README file giving a brief overview of the profile, and an examples folder. 

Within the examples folder, you will find subfolders corresponding to different versions of the profile. Within these folders you will provide examples of markup that conform to the specific version of a profile.
