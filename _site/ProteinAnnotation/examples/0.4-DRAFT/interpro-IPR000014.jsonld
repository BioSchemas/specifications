	"name": "PAS domain",
	"description": "PAS domains are involved in many signalling proteins where they are used as a signal sensor domain [PMID: 10357859]. PAS domains appear in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Several PAS-domain proteins are known to detect their signal by way of an associated cofactor. Haeme, flavin, and a 4-hydroxycinnamyl chromophore are used in different proteins. The PAS domain was named after three proteins that it occurs in: 1) Per- period circadian protein 2) Arnt- Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein 3) Sim- single-minded protein."
