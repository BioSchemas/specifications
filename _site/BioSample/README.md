## Profile

The [BioSample Profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/BioSample) presents the Bioschemas markup when describing a BioSample. It provides more specific properties than the generic [Sample Profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Sample). 

### Example Markup

This repository contains example markup for the BioSample profile generated by the [Samples group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Samples/). Examples are purely illustrative and may use fictional data. 

Examples should be stored in a subfolder indicating which version of the profile it is valid for. Please check to ensure the example you are reading matches the version of the profile you are interested in.
