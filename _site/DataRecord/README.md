## Profile

The [DataRecord profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/DataRecord) provides a way to denote the metadata associated with an individual record in a dataset.

### Example Markup

This repository contains example markup for the DataRecord profile generated by the [Datasets group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Datasets/). Examples are purely illustrative and may use fictional data. 

Examples should be stored in a subfolder indicating which version of the profile it is valid for. Please check to ensure the example you are reading matches the version of the profile you are interested in.

**Creating your own DataRecord metadata:**

1. Copy the `template.json` example.
2. Change the values of the minimum fields.
3. Add as many recommended and optional fields as possible.
4. Wrap up the example using script tags.

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
  ....
</script>
```

5. Embed the example in your site.
