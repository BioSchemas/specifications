# Profile for DefinedTerm and DefinedTermSet

The two SchemaOrg types DefinedTerm and DefinedTermSet
are allowed in many places as property values.

In e.g. the life-sciences, there are a number of controlled vocabularies
and ontologies, which are often used as source of the DefinedTerms.

For linked data applications it is sufficient to link to an `@id`.

In other cases, more information is needed to search and view defined term information.
Some typical OBO ontologies can be taken as inspiration of properties that should be
required or recommended in a Bioschema DefinedTerm profile.
